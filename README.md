# Plant Tracker app

#### This is a simple time-tracking app that helps you follow a proper watering schedule to keep your leafy friends from dying prematurely. 

[Watch our short demo on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqFQMtKYtgA) 

This build is free to use and extend to your liking. You can contribute or ask for any new features to be added. Either way it is preferable to [start an issue](https://github.com/Abductcows/plant-tracker/issues) so that you do not make any wasted effort. The app currently does not do any deliberate online synchronization or have ads. 

Note: There are currently a few missing features such as a notification reminder. You can find them in the [issues page](https://github.com/Abductcows/plant-tracker/issues). You should feel free to implement those first if you are so inclined.
